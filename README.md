# Absence 🌴

A vacation-approval workflow for Nextcloud: employees apply for leave, line managers
approve or reject, and HR gets a company-wide overview with statistics and exports.

Built to the specification in [SPECIFICATION.md](./SPECIFICATION.md).

## Features

- **Apply** for annual, sick, unpaid or special leave (configurable types) with a live
  balance preview. The working-day count is prefilled from your availability and
  public holidays in personal settings.
- **Approve / reject** as a line manager, with team-coverage conflict warnings.
- **Escalation**: pending requests a manager ignores are automatically escalated to HR.
- **Full balance tracking**: entitlement, used, pending, remaining and carry-over,
  with a configurable year-rollover policy. *My leave* shows each balance as an
  animated ring with a breakdown ledger (base + carry-over ± adjustment → available)
  and monthly charts of leave taken and sick days for the current year.
- **HR area**: per-employee balances, company-wide statistics, a who's-off calendar,
  and CSV export.
- **Calendar sync**: approved leave is written to a personal and a shared team calendar
  via CalDAV.
- **Notifications, email and activity** for every step.
- Native Nextcloud UI (Vue 3 + `@nextcloud/vue`), dark-mode aware, translatable.

## Screenshots

### Employee

**My leave** — next-break hero, balance ring with breakdown ledger, monthly leave & sick-day charts, and the request list:

**Request time off** — leave type, replacement picker, dates and prefilled (editable) working days:

**Dashboard widget** — balance summary, upcoming leave and (for managers) requests awaiting a decision:

### Line managers

**Approving a request** — detail sidebar with progress stepper, coverage and history:

**Team timeline** — who's off this month, pending requests hatched:

### HR

**Record absence** — book sick leave (or any type) for an employee directly, without an approval step:

**Balances** — per-employee entitlement, used, pending, remaining and available:

![HR balances table](screenshots/7.png)

**Edit entitlement** — base days plus a manual adjustment with a note:

**Who's off** — company-wide absence timeline:

**Statistics** — stat tiles, absence-days trend and days by leave type:

**Exports** — leave requests and balances as CSV:

**Requesting leave works the same from the HR area:**

### Administration

**Admin settings** — HR group, entitlements, escalation, carry-over policy and CalDAV targets:

## Roles

| Role | How it's assigned |
|------|-------------------|
| Employee | every user |
| Line manager | the account `manager` property (from LDAP or set on the account) |
| HR | membership of a configurable group (default `hr`, see admin settings) |
| Admin | Nextcloud server admins configure the app |

## Architecture

- **Backend** — PHP on the Nextcloud App Framework:
  - `lib/Db` — entities + QBMappers (`absence_requests`, `absence_leave_types`,
    `absence_entitlements`, `absence_comments`, `absence_request_events`).
  - `lib/Service` — the domain logic. `RequestService` owns the state machine;
    `BalanceService`, `CoverageService`, `EntitlementService`,
    `CalendarService`, `NotificationService`, `ReportService`, `ExportService`,
    `PermissionService`, `ManagerResolver`, `ConfigService`, `SessionService`,
    `ActivityPublisher`.
  - `lib/Controller` — thin JSON controllers behind `appinfo/routes.php`.
  - `lib/BackgroundJob` — `EscalationJob` (hourly), `ReminderJob` (daily),
    `YearRolloverJob` (daily, idempotent per year).
  - `lib/Notification`, `lib/Activity`, `lib/Settings`, `lib/Listener`, `lib/Migration`.
- **Frontend** — Vue 3 SPA in `src/`, built with `@nextcloud/vite-config` into `js/`.

## Development

```bash
# PHP: lint / static analysis / tests (run from the server root or here)
composer install
composer cs:check
composer psalm

# Frontend
npm install --legacy-peer-deps   # ecosystem peer ranges require this flag
npm run build                    # → js/absence-*.mjs, css/*
npm run watch                    # rebuild on change during development
```

Enable the app:

```bash
occ app:enable absence
```

The default leave types (annual, sick, unpaid, special) are seeded on install.

## Configuration

Admin settings live under **Administration settings → Absence** (HR group, default
entitlement, escalation window, carry-over policy, coverage threshold, CalDAV targets).

Personal settings are appended to the built-in **Personal settings → Availability**
page. They prefill the "Working days" field on new requests: working weekdays come
from the user's Availability (overridable), and a chosen country/region marks the
public holidays that should not be counted as working days. The last replacement is
also remembered and prefilled. Every prefilled value stays editable on the request
itself. Notification preferences defer to the global Nextcloud notification settings.

## Audit logging

Every important action — request created / edited / approved / rejected / cancelled,
withdrawal requested/approved/rejected, escalation, comments, entitlement changes,
carry-over rollover/expiry, leave-type and holiday changes, admin-config changes, and
GDPR user-data purge — is written to **`nextcloud.log`** as a structured JSON entry
tagged `"app":"absence"` with a machine-readable `action` and full context (actor,
request id, employee, type, dates, working days, status).

These entries are **always written regardless of the instance log level**: on install
(and every update) the app adds `absence` to the system `log.condition.apps` list,
which Nextcloud honours by forcing DEBUG-level capture for the app's tagged messages.
The existing condition is merged, never replaced, and the entry is removed again on
uninstall. Filter the log with e.g. `grep '"app":"absence"' nextcloud.log` or by a
specific `"action"`.

## Status vs. specification

Phase 1 (per the spec's "definition of done") is implemented, plus a role-aware
**Dashboard widget**: every employee sees their own balance and upcoming/pending
leave, line managers additionally see team requests awaiting their decision, and HR
sees the escalated queue across the company. Phase-2 items — file attachments for
doctor's notes, ICS holiday import, and half-day granularity — are intentionally left
as follow-ups; the schema already reserves room for half-days.
